The D.A.R.T Dart Device is a sophisticated tool designed to provide driver assistance and vehicle tracking functionalities for emergency vehicles. It allows users to mark and track nearby vehicles, significantly enhancing their ability to respond to emergencies effectively.

#### Features

- **Vehicle Tracking**: Track nearby vehicles from the equipped emergency vehicle.
- **Real-time Updates**: Marked vehicle location updates are displayed in real-time on the map.
- **Blip Expiry Timer**: Blips expire after a set duration to avoid clutter on the map.
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents spamming of the tracking feature by imposing a cooldown period.
- **Customizable Blip Settings**: Configure the appearance of blips on the map.
- **Configurable Options**: Customize various aspects such as cooldown duration, blip settings, command usage, and keybind.
- **Dart Attach Success Sound**: Provides audible feedback upon successful attachment of the dart.

#### Usage

To utilize the D.A.R.T Dart Device, equip it in an emergency vehicle and activate the firing mechanism. The nearest vehicle will be marked with a blip on the map, indicating its location. The blip is visible to all users in the vicinity. There is a cooldown period between each tracking attempt to ensure fair usage.

#### Removal Process

To remove the tracking device from a vehicle, use the Angle Grinder item. The Angle Grinder effectively removes the tracker, disabling its functionality. The Angle Grinding process includes an animation and a skill check to ensure successful removal.
